# Colorize Black and White Photos
Using convolutional neural network to colorize black and white portraits.

### Quick Use:
 - Add colored pictures in `images-colored` folder
 - Run `code/make_black_and_white.py` code to make black and white versions
 - Code will also create dictionaries `X_DICT_BW_TRAIN` and `Y_DICT_COLOR_TRAIN`, which will be fed to the CNN for training
